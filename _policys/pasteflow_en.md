# Privacy Policy for PasteFlow

Thank you for using PasteFlow (“the App”). We take your privacy and data security seriously. This Privacy Policy explains clearly how the App collects, uses, stores, and protects your personal information.

## 1. Local Data Storage

The App **does not** upload your clipboard content to any cloud servers or third-party services. All clipboard history—including text, images, files, audio, and video—is stored **exclusively on your local device** and is only accessible through the App on that device.

## 2. Required System Permissions

To enable core functionality, the App requests the following macOS system permissions:

- **Accessibility Permission**: To monitor system clipboard changes and capture copied content.

These permissions are used solely for the purposes described in the product documentation and will not be used for any other purpose. You may revoke these permissions at any time via System Settings, though doing so will disable certain features.

## 3. Sensitive Information Protection

The App includes a built-in sensitive content filter. If content potentially containing passwords, credit card numbers, or other sensitive data (e.g., copied from password managers or login forms) is detected, the App will **automatically ignore and discard that clipboard entry**, without saving or displaying it.

## 4. Data Retention and Deletion

You can manage your data at any time by:

- Manually clearing all clipboard history in Settings;
- Configuring automatic retention policies (e.g., keep for 1 day, 7 days, up to 365 days);
- Setting a maximum number of entries (10–5,000), after which the oldest records are automatically deleted.

All locally stored clipboard data will be automatically erased when you uninstall the App.

## 5. Third-Party Sharing

We **do not** share, sell, or transfer your clipboard data with any third parties.

## 6. Contact Us
