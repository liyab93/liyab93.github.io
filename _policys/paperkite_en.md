## Privacy Policy

Thank you for using our PaperKite application. We take your privacy seriously. Below is an explanation of how we collect, use, and protect your information.

### Information We Collect
This application does not collect, store, or share any personal data from users.
When you choose to use a custom key to access third-party wallpaper platforms (e.g., Pexels, Pixabay, or Unsplash), your key will only be stored locally on your device and used by the application. It will never be uploaded or shared.

### How We Use Information
- The application uses built-in or user-provided API keys to access third-party platforms to fetch wallpaper content.
- User-provided keys are used locally during runtime to interact with the selected platform’s API.

### Data Storage and Security
- User keys and any data required for program execution are stored locally on the user’s device.
- We adopt reasonable technical measures to protect the security of locally stored data, but you are responsible for securing your device.

### Third-Party Services
- This application integrates APIs from Pexels, Pixabay, and Unsplash. These platforms may have their own privacy policies, and we recommend reviewing them for further details.
- The content accessed through API keys is provided by third parties, and the relevant terms are determined by the respective platforms.

### Updates to the Privacy Policy
- We may update this privacy policy as needed. Any changes will be reflected in the latest version of the application. Please review this policy periodically.
